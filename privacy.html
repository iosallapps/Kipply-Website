            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 3, 2025</p>
            <p class="last-updated"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 3, 2025</p>

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to Kipply ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how Kipply handles your data when you use our mobile application (the "App").
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Our Privacy Promise:</strong> Kipply is a privacy-first photo cleaning application. We do NOT collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal information or photos. All photo processing happens locally on your device.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
            <p>Kipply does NOT collect, access, store, or transmit:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Your Photos or Videos:</strong> We never upload, store, or transmit your photos or videos to our servers or any third-party servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or any other personally identifiable information.</li>
                <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> We do not access or collect your device's location information.</li>
                <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> We do not collect device IDs, advertising identifiers, or any unique identifiers (before AdMob integration).</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> We do not track how you use the app, which features you access, or any behavioral data (in the current version).</li>
                <li><strong>Contacts or Other Device Data:</strong> We do not access your contacts, messages, calendar, or any other data on your device besides photos.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Photo Library Access</h2>
            <h3>3.1 Why We Need Access</h3>
            <p>
                Kipply requires access to your photo library to provide its core functionality: helping you organize and delete unwanted photos. This access is mandatory for the app to function.
            </p>

            <h3>3.2 How We Use Photo Access</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Processing Only:</strong> All photo analysis, thumbnail generation, and organization happen entirely on your iPhone/iPad. Your photos never leave your device.</li>
                <li><strong>PhotoBin Feature:</strong> When you swipe left to delete a photo, it is queued in the PhotoBin temporarily. This queue is stored locally on your device using iOS UserDefaults.</li>
                <li><strong>Permanent Deletion:</strong> When you permanently delete photos from PhotoBin, they are removed from your device's photo library using Apple's Photos framework. We do not create backups or copies.</li>
                <li><strong>Statistics Tracking:</strong> Basic statistics (e.g., number of photos reviewed, deleted) are stored locally on your device and are never transmitted to us.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.3 Your Control</h3>
            <p>You can revoke photo library access at any time through iOS Settings → Kipply → Photos. However, this will prevent the app from functioning.</p>

            <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
            <p>All data generated by Kipply is stored locally on your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>PhotoBin Queue:</strong> Temporarily stored in iOS UserDefaults on your device</li>
                <li><strong>Statistics:</strong> Stored in iOS UserDefaults on your device</li>
                <li><strong>Preferences:</strong> App settings stored in iOS UserDefaults</li>
                <li><strong>iCloud Sync:</strong> If you have iCloud Photo Library enabled, photo deletions will sync across your devices via Apple's iCloud, not our servers</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>We do NOT have access to any of this data.</strong> It never leaves your device except through Apple's own iCloud sync (if enabled).</p>

            <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <h3>5.1 Current Version (No Third Parties)</h3>
            <p>
                The current version of Kipply (v1.0) does NOT use any third-party services, analytics, or advertising networks. Your data is not shared with anyone.
            </p>

            <h3>5.2 Future Versions (AdMob Integration Planned)</h3>
            <p>
                In a future update, we plan to integrate Google AdMob to display advertisements. When this happens, this Privacy Policy will be updated, and the following data may be collected by AdMob:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Device identifiers (Advertising ID)</li>
                <li>IP address</li>
                <li>Ad interaction data (impressions, clicks)</li>
                <li>Device information (model, OS version)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We will notify you via an app update before implementing ads, and you will have the option to review the updated Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Important:</strong> Even with AdMob, your photos will NEVER be accessed, uploaded, or shared. Ads are generic and not personalized based on your photo content.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                Kipply is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@kipplyapp.com">support@kipplyapp.com</a>, and we will take steps to delete such information.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
            <p>
                Since Kipply does not collect or transmit your data, there is no risk of data breaches on our end. Your photos and data remain securely on your device, protected by iOS's built-in security features:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>iOS Sandboxing (apps cannot access each other's data)</li>
                <li>Device encryption</li>
                <li>Apple's secure photo library permissions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We recommend keeping your device locked with a passcode and enabling two-factor authentication for your Apple ID.</p>

            <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
            <p>Since we do not collect your personal information, traditional data rights (access, deletion, portability) do not apply. However, you have full control over your data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Delete App Data:</strong> Uninstall the app to remove all local data (PhotoBin queue, statistics, preferences).</li>
                <li><strong>Reset Statistics:</strong> Use the "Reset All Statistics" option in Settings to clear tracked data.</li>
                <li><strong>Revoke Access:</strong> Deny photo library access in iOS Settings to prevent the app from accessing your photos.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>9. International Users</h2>
            <p>
                Kipply is designed for global use. Since all data processing happens locally on your device, there are no cross-border data transfers to worry about. Your data never leaves your device.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>GDPR Compliance (EU Users):</strong> We comply with GDPR because we do not process personal data. Your photos remain on your device.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>CCPA Compliance (California Users):</strong> We do not sell your personal information because we do not collect it.
            </p>

            <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>
                We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, especially if we integrate third-party services like AdMob. When we make changes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy</li>
                <li>We will notify you via an in-app message or App Store update notes</li>
                <li>The updated policy will be posted at <a href="https://kipplyapp.com/privacy.html">https://kipplyapp.com/privacy.html</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
            </p>

            <h2>12. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
            <p>
                For EU users, we want to clarify that we do NOT process your personal data under GDPR definitions because:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>All processing happens locally on your device (not by us)</li>
                <li>We do not act as a data controller or processor</li>
                <li>Your photos and personal information never reach our servers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you have concerns about Apple's iCloud Photo Library (which syncs your photos across devices), please review Apple's Privacy Policy at <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/</a>.
