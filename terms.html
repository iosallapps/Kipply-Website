            <h2>3. App Functionality</h2>
            <h3>3.1 What Kipply Does</h3>
            <p>
                Kipply is a photo cleaning and organization application that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Allows you to swipe through your photos to decide which to keep or delete</li>
                <li>Provides a PhotoBin feature to review photos before permanent deletion</li>
                <li>Tracks statistics about your photo cleaning activity</li>
                <li>Organizes photos by date and provides discovery features</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.2 Photo Access and Deletion</h3>
            <p>
                Kipply requires access to your device's photo library to function. By granting this access, you authorize the App to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Read and display your photos and videos</li>
                <li>Delete photos and videos from your device when you explicitly request deletion</li>
                <li>Generate thumbnails for display purposes (stored locally on your device)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> All photo processing happens locally on your device. Kipply does NOT upload, store, or transmit your photos to our servers or any third party.
            </p>

            <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
            <h3>4.1 Photo Deletion is Permanent</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>⚠️ WARNING:</strong> When you permanently delete photos from PhotoBin, they are removed from your device and cannot be recovered by Kipply. Photo deletion is permanent and irreversible.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>You are solely responsible for:</strong>

                <li>Reviewing photos carefully before deletion</li>
                <li>Understanding that the PhotoBin feature is a temporary queue, not a permanent backup</li>
                <li>Any data loss resulting from your use of the App</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>We strongly recommend backing up your photos to iCloud, Google Photos, or another cloud service before using Kipply.</strong>
            </p>

            <h3>4.2 Eligibility</h3>
            <p>
                You must be at least 13 years old to use Kipply. If you are under 18, you must have permission from a parent or legal guardian to use the App.
            </p>

            <h3>4.3 Account Security</h3>
            <p>
